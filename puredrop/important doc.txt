Don't Start the application without asking it will ruin the random access token and Application part will not work after that.

sudo npm install -g --unsafe-perm homebridge homebridge-config-ui-x
sudo hb-service install
http://localhost:8581


Start the docker daemon before running the docker instance 
docker compose up 
homebridge userid - riszzav password - *askpersonally*
